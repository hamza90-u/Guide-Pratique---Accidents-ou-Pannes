## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep, professional blue (#235FB9), signifying trust and corporate identity, ideal for headlines and key information.
- Background color: A soft, desaturated off-white (#ECF0F6), promoting readability and a clean aesthetic for the light scheme.
- Accent color: A vibrant, clear blue (#34B5E2) for calls-to-action, important alerts, and interactive elements to draw attention without being overwhelming.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a modern, geometric, and precise look. Body text font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for its high readability and objective clarity in a guide context.
- Use clear, universally recognizable line-style icons for vehicle checks, safety actions (e.g., triangle, gilet), and emergency services. Icons should be functional and easy to understand at a glance.
- A clean, modular layout with distinct sections for pre-use checks and emergency procedures. Utilize accordions or expandable sections for detailed steps, and clear visual hierarchy for important warnings and contact information. Fully responsive for desktop and mobile access.
- Subtle entrance animations for content sections, smooth hover effects on clickable elements (e.g., phone numbers, email links), and small looping animations for instructional visuals like tire checks or flashing lights, to guide attention without distraction.
